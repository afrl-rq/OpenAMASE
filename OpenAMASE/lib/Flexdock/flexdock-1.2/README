This is the readme for the binary distribution.  If you want to use the
sources to build and run flexdock demos, then see README-BUILD.

Running the Demos
---------------------
The demo jar requires both the flexdock-<version>.jar and lib\*.jar.  The
manifest for the demo expects the flexdock-<version>.jar to be in the same
directory and all other dependencies to be located in a subdirectory lib.
If you do not move any of the jars, you can run the demo jar using:

  java -jar flexdock-demo-<version>.jar

or if your GUI shell supports running a jar file by clicking or double
clicking on it's icon, then do that.
